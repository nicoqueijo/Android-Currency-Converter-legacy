# DEPRECATED

⚠️ **This repository is no longer maintained and has been archived.** ⚠️

After 4+ years of this project being inactive the Android landscape evolved significantly. To update it with modern tools and best practices, it was determined that starting a new project from scratch would be more efficient and maintainable. As a result, this repository has been deprecated.
